# TNPG: OreoMcFlurry
Emily Ortiz & Jing Yi Feng

### Project Description
We created the classic game Simon. There are four buttons, and one lights up randomly. Your job is to repeat the pattern by pressing the same button. If you get everything right, another color is added onto the pattern. Keep playing until you misclick or wait too long to press a button.

### How to Launch
1. Clone our repo with ```git clone git@github.com:eortiz-30/OreoMcFlurry.git```
2. cd into our repo (```cd OreoMcFlurry```)
3. cd into the Simon directory (```cd Simon```)
4. Run the command ```processing Simon.pde``` in terminal
5. Once the Processing window pops up, press the Run button in the top left corner
